# Welcome!

I'm a Full-Stack Dev and I'm 2 years in so far. I like coding in Typescript right now and I can't pick between Angular and React, as they both are pretty cool.
Currently working on random items such a minor projects with friends, new portfolio, working as a dev in the day and making a mobile app for fun.
My old portfolio is below along with my LinkedIn. Looking to join open source projects!
